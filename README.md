# Background Replacement with DeepLabV3

This project uses a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model to perform semantic segmentation on images, isolating the foreground (person) and replacing the background with a new image.

## Usage

1. Place your images in the `images` directory.
2. Run the `main.py` script to generate an output image with the new background.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
